# Implementation of ERC 223 token (TRON)

*Read this in other languages: [English](README.en.md), [简体中文](README.zh.md), [日本語](README.ja.md).*

## Overview

This is the source code and documentation that has modified the ERC 223 token to work with [TRON | Decentralize The Web](https://tron.network/) .

- The compiler does not support `pragma solidity ^0.5.0;` of `SafeMath.sol` `Address.sol` of openzeppelin-solidity, so it is included in the project and is called `pragma solidity ^0.4.23;` .

## Token setting

The implementation is such that the token name, symbol, total supply amount, and the number of decimal places can be changed by the variables in the `migrations/2_deploy_tron_token.js` file.

```es6
const fs = require('fs');
const ERC223Token = artifacts.require('ERC223Token');

const name = 'GToken'; // Specify the name of your token
const symbol = 'GT'; // Specify the symbol of your token
const decimals = 18; // Number of decimal places
const totalSupply = 1000000000; // Total supply of tokens (integer representation)

module.exports = (deployer) => {
    deployer.deploy(ERC223Token, name, symbol, decimals, totalSupply).then(() => {
        // Save ABI to file
        fs.mkdirSync('deploy/abi/', { recursive: true });
        fs.writeFileSync('deploy/abi/ERC223Token.json', JSON.stringify(ERC223Token.abi), { flag: 'w' });
    });
};
```

**Token name**

```es6
const name = 'GToken'; // Specify the name of your token
```

**Unit of token**

```es6
const symbol = 'GT'; // Specify the symbol of your token
```

**Number of digits after the decimal point**

```es6
const decimals = 18; // Number of decimal places
```

**Total supply amount (integer expression)**

```es6
const totalSupply = 1000000000; // Total supply of tokens (integer representation)
```

## specification

For basic specifications, implement the functions and specifications discussed in the following URL.

[Dexaran / ERC223-token-standard at Recommended](https://github.com/Dexaran/ERC223-token-standard/tree/Recommended)

As an exception, the following functions have not been implemented because they have determined that they may cause unintended operation.

```solidity
  function transfer(address to, uint value, bytes data, string custom_fallback) public returns (bool ok);
```

As an additional specification, it is implemented to check the return value when executing `tokenFallback()` , which is discussed in the following URL. This addresses the loss of tokens due to the fallback function being executed.

## Test Cases

[Confirm](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tron-box) operation with test script using [tronprotocol / tron-box](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tron-box) .

Paste the test execution results below.

```bash
$ tronbox test
